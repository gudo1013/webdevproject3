                    <b>What We Used</b>
                </div>
                The tools we used to make this website were Nominatim, Leaflet, Vue.js and Foundation. 
                Nominatim is a tool used to get a human-readable address of a location from coordinates of a location. 
                We used this in our website when dealing with the map that used latitude and longitude 
                coordinates to get readable addresses. Leaflet is a tool that makes map creation and management easier. 
                We used this tool in the making of our St. Paul neighborhood map. Vue.js is a client side framework 
                that allows for reactive data. This was used in the making of our table that reacts to changes in 
                the data and updates without refreshing the page. Foundation is a framework that allows for easier 
                organization of a websites structure. We used this for structuring our website.
